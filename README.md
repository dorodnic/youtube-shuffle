# YouTube Shuffle

This is a toy-project to help you rediscover your YouTube subscriptions. Live demo [here](https://dorodnic.github.io/youtube-shuffle).

> Once you sign-in with a Google account, you will get a random list of videos from your existing subscriptions. There's no algorithm or data-collection, every time you get a new unique page of random goodies.

The source code was designed to help you get started with YouTube JavaScript API's, including OAuth2 sign-in, channels, playlists and subscribtions. It also showcases basic use of [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
